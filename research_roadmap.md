# Research Roadmap: Hormone Measurement Devices

**Goal:** Utilize remaining credits to generate a comprehensive "State of the Art" report on hormone biosensors.

**Estimated Cost:** ~8-12 Credits
**Timeline:** Execute immediately.

## Proposed Research Modules

### 1. Stability & Bio-Fouling (Literature)
**The Problem:** Wearable sensors in sweat degrade quickly due to enzymes and bio-fouling.
**Query:** *"What are the most effective recent strategies to prevent bio-fouling and extend the shelf-life of aptamer-based sweat sensors?"*

### 2. Multiplexing (Literature)
**The Problem:** Measuring just cortisol isn't enough; ratios (e.g., Cortisol/Testosterone) are more valuable.
**Query:** *"What technologies exist for simultaneous real-time monitoring of cortisol and testosterone (multiplexed) in a single wearable device?"*

### 3. Powering the Device (Literature / Precedent)
**The Problem:** Batteries are bulky.
**Query:** *"Has anyone successfully integrated enzymatic biofuel cells with hormone biosensors to create a self-powered wearable?"*

### 4. Chemical Design (Molecules)
**The Design:** Designing a sensor for **Testosterone** (a key hormone for tracking recovery/performance).
**Query:** *"Calculate LogP for Testosterone. Design a Molecularly Imprinted Polymer (MIP) for Testosterone by suggesting 3 optimal functional monomers."*

### 5. Commercial Landscape (Precedent)
**The Competition:** Who is already doing this?
**Query:** *"List all startup companies or commercial products currently developing or selling continuous wearable cortisol monitors."*

## Output
I will compile the answers from all these tasks into a single **Master Research Report**.

**Shall I proceed with all modules?**
